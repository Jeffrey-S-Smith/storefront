# Getting Started with Create React App

## Phase 2 Requirements

In phase 2, we will be adding the “Add to Cart” feature to our application, which will allow our users to not only browse items in the store, but also select them and have them persist in their “shopping cart” for later purchase.

The user stories from Phase 1 remain unchanged. For this phase, we are now adding the following new user stories to meet the new requirements.

As a user, I want to choose from products in the list and add them to my shopping cart
As a user, I want to see the products that I’ve added to my shopping cart so that
As a user, I want to change the quantity of items I intend to purchase in my shopping cart
As a user, I want to be able to remove an item from my shopping cart

## Overview
This site is a virtual store that can show users what products are for sale. The items can be sorted by category and added to a cart. By clicking the cart icon, they can see how many items are in the cart. It can also keeps track of inventory by incrementing and decrementing inventory counts when a user adds and removes items from their cart.

## My test suite uses [RTL](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) to cover the following cases:

1. Display a list of all `categories` from the Redux Store
2. Display a list of all `products` within a selected category
3. Displays components using Material UI

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
